# Usage

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome:

```sh
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

Now run it against this repo:
```sh
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/Contraric/drupal-cookiecutter.git
```

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Drupal docker project will be created for you.
